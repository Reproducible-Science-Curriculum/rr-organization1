# Organization 1

## Overview and learning objectives

Students will learn the benefits of project and folder organization,
and how these enable reproducibility and reusability. They will then
complete an activity where they use provided examples to set up the structure and naming conventions for a new project.

At the end of the session students will be able to

- Evaluate folder and file structure of a project.
- Recognize common problems that occur in file organization.
- Distinguish between input and output files.
- Setup up a new project with a structure that facilitates reproducibility
